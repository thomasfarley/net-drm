## Notice

This library includes the source for a <b>very basic</b> implementation of an offline hash-key based digital rights management system. This is
not suitable for use in commercial software and is not intended to be used as such. There are many vulnerabilities that are not
addressed in this library at this time.

This is part of a work in progress of a fully open sourced digital rights management system for use in any .NET application.
